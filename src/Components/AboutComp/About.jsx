            <p>I am Kirtiraj Ananda Kumbhar, a recent Master of Computer Applications (MCA) graduate with a strong foundation in programming, web development, and data analytics. My journey as a developer began during my academic years, where I had the opportunity to work on various projects using languages such as Java, Python, and JavaScript, as well as frameworks like Angular.

I am passionate about leveraging technology to create solutions that improve efficiency and solve real-world problems. My approach to development focuses on clean, scalable code and a desire to explore new tools and technologies.

                   <br /><br />I am excited to bring my skills and enthusiasm to a team where I can contribute, learn, and grow. With a strong work ethic and a commitment to continuous improvement, I am eager to take the next step in my career and begin contributing to meaningful projects in a professional setting.</p>
